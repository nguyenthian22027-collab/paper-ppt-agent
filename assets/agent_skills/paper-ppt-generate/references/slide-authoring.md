# Slide SVG Authoring

Author clean SVG for PowerPoint conversion.

Canvas:

- Use the exact `viewBox` from `agent_task.json.presentation.viewbox`.
- Common 16:9 canvas is `0 0 1280 720`.
- Common 4:3 canvas is `0 0 1024 768`.

Layout:

- Keep margins stable across the deck.
- Avoid tiny text. Prefer fewer, clearer points.
- Use template assets in `templates/` when available.
- Author one explicitly named slide SVG at a time. Do not build a deck generator, loop over slide definitions, or emit pages through shared renderer functions. Each page's layout and final SVG markup must be written for that page.
- Shared colors, typography, margins, and recurring chrome may be repeated directly. They are not permission to reuse a universal page skeleton or card grid for unrelated content.
- Put styling directly on SVG elements. Do not use `<style>` blocks or `class=` attributes in final slide SVGs; inline `fill`, `stroke`, `font-family`, `font-size`, opacity, and line attributes instead.
- Use local icons from the configured icons path; verify files exist before referencing them.
- Design each slide's spatial layout before drawing. Choose a layout family from the Slide Plan, then place figures, text, cards, charts, and callouts in aligned rectangular regions with 24-40px gutters.
- For ordinary content slides, aim for 65-85% meaningful occupancy of the content area. Whitespace is useful for hierarchy, but do not leave an empty quadrant, a short bullet list floating in a large blank field, or a bottom callout visually detached from the main grid.
- Use 24-40px gutters between major regions and align edges across repeated layout families.
- **Visual depth is required** — flat pages without elevation look unfinished. Use filter shadows on cards/panels, gradients for backgrounds/overlays, accent top-bars on cards, and subtle decorative elements. Every card should have a shadow, an accent element, and proper inner padding — not just a plain flat rect with a stroke border.
- **Visual hierarchy**: use large bold numbers with small gray labels for KPI/metrics. Use color-coded status indicators. Use accent callout boxes with tinted backgrounds for key takeaways.
- **Color rules**: 60-30-10 rule (primary 60%, secondary 30%, accent 10%). Maximum 4 colors per page. Use monochromatic opacity variations for chart series.
- For figure slides, reserve the figure frame first and fit the image inside that frame preserving aspect ratio. Do not stretch the paper figure to fill a convenient box.
- If content is sparse, fill space with a supported visual explanation: enlarge the paper figure, split bullets into labeled callouts, add a mechanism/process diagram grounded in the paper, or use a comparison strip. Do not invent data, axes, or decorative mini charts.
- Before writing markup, check actual text geometry for each box. At minimum, require `text_right <= box_right - padding` and `last_baseline + font_size*0.25 <= box_bottom - padding`.
- Reserve vertical space explicitly: heading, heading-to-body gap, `line_count * line_height`, caption/source, and bottom padding. Do not use an 80px card for a heading plus two body lines merely because the first baseline fits.
- For tables, measure the longest visible cell in each column, assign column widths first, and right-align numeric columns. Do not position rows by guessed x coordinates that let labels and values overlap.

Icons:

- Match icons only after identifying a concrete icon need. Use filesystem commands against `agent_task.json.paths.icons` to list and match available `.svg` filenames directly.
- Do not use `skills/paper-ppt-generate/scripts/search_icons.py`, `index_meta.json`, `index.npz`, icon metadata files, or vector indexes while choosing an icon.
- Allowed icons are existing local SVG/icon files or template-provided vector assets that actually exist. Verify the file exists before referencing it.
- Do not use text glyphs (letters, emoji, Unicode symbols, arrows, stars) as icon substitutes. If no suitable icon exists, omit it or use a neutral shape.
- Keep `design_spec.md` or `agent_report.json` aware of the icon choices so QA can check missing assets and policy violations.

Text:

- Use normal SVG `<text>` elements.
- Avoid excessive nested `tspan` complexity.
- Do not use `foreignObject`, `<style>`, CSS classes, masks, clip paths, scripts, event handlers, or remote URLs.
- Wrap against each text box's actual width and font size.
- For Chinese body copy, let ordinary non-final lines use most of the available width, break at semantic boundaries, and allow light raggedness. Do not force a fixed characters-per-line target.
- If wrapping is clearly wasteful or clips, widen or reallocate the text region, tune gaps, or adjust typography. Do not create huge blank bands with unnecessarily narrow text boxes.
- Preserve exact source numbers and units. Do not use K/M/B shorthand, reduce decimal precision, or manufacture chart ticks unless the source itself does so. Put transparent derivations and their inputs on the same slide.

Images:

- Use local relative paths.
- Prefer figures that directly support the slide's argument.
- Avoid remote URLs.
- For paper figures, read `source_assets/figures.json` or `source_assets/figures.md`.
- Use the exact manifest `href` in `<image href="...">`; from `svg_output/` it normally starts with `../source_assets/images/`.
- Preserve the listed natural aspect ratio. If you need a different visual box, letterbox or crop deliberately with SVG clipping; do not stretch the image.
- Choose figures by caption, page number, section/context, and slide claim. Do not choose a figure only because the filename looks convenient.

Consistency:

- Write `design_spec.md` before drafting many slides.
- For parallel slide authoring, treat `design_spec.md` as the single source of visual truth.
- For a chapter slide, inspect at most the two latest earlier chapter-slide SVGs. For a content slide, inspect at most the two latest earlier content-slide SVGs, skipping structural pages.
- Structural slides (cover, TOC, chapter, ending) should be sparse.
- Content slides should prioritize method, evidence, results, and takeaways.
- Consistency means common visual rules, not identical page construction. Select each content slide's layout from its own evidence shape: figure, process, comparison, table, equation, or argument.
